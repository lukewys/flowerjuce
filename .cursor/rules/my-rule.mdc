- prefer composition over inheritance
- when writing complex math or logic, prefer to write all the main logic encased in stateless functions, and have wrapper classes that rely on stateless function (think torch.nn.functional and the nn Module for torch). 
- place DBG statements to thoroughly document the flow of code, except in Audio threads where timing is critical. In audio threads, DBG every 2s or so.
